erl_tempcache is a small caching server for erlang use.
It loosely follows the Memcached client api, and 
generally works the same way.

To use:
Compile all erl files (erl followed by c(filename).) -- 
    eventually there will be a makefile for this.

Start by calling cache_sup:start_link().
Functions are as follows:
add(Key, Val, [Timeout]) -> ok or {error, exists}
set(Key, Val, [Timeout]) -> ok
get(Key) -> {ok, Val} or none
del(Key) -> ok

maxsize is defined in settings.cfg

TODO:
Eventually, I would like to make this into a full caching server 
with an http interface to store JSON objects. It was primarily
created for use in an auth project that loads and caches
users and data from disc.
